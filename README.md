# SpectralML- Spectral Analysis for Music recommendation


Music streaming services have grown popular in the last decade. It is now easier than ever to listen to music regardless of where we are; however, finding music that suits our taste still seems to be quite a challenge. While popular music streaming platforms generate recommended playlists, the use of collaborative filtering and/or hybrid filtering creates a bias and shifts away from the music itself. We aim to tackle that problem and make recommendations based on the spectral features of the songs.

The scope of this project will be limited to the classification of the songs into various genres based on the said features.
